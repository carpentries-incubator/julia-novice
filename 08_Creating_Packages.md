## Objectives

  - "Learn setting up a project using modules."
  - "Learn common package structure."
  - "Learn to browse GitHub or juliahub for packages and find documentation."

Melissa is now confident that her module is fine and she wants to make it
available for the rest of her physics club.
She decides to put it in a package.
This way she can also locally use Julia's package manager for managing her
module.

## From project to package

The path from having a module to having a package is actually very short:
Packages need a `name` and a `uuid` field in their `Project.toml`.

A UUID is a **u**niversally **u**nique **id**entifier.
Thankfully Julia comes with the `UUIDs` package, that can generate `uuid`s for
Melissa via `UUIDs.uuid4()`.

In addition Melissa needs to have a specific directory structure.
She looks at the example package [`Example.jl`](https://github.com/JuliaLang/Example.jl) which has the following
structure:

```
├── docs
│   ├── make.jl
│   ├── Project.toml
│   └── src
│       └── index.md
├── LICENSE.md
├── Project.toml
├── README.md
├── src
│   └── Example.jl
└── test
    └── runtests.jl
```

## Make it a package

Open your `Project.toml` and add `name = <your name>`, `uuid = <your uuid>`
and optionally an `authors` field, each on a separate line.

Now Melissa can use

```julia
pkg> dev . # or path to package instead of `.`
```

instead of needing to `includet MelissasModule.jl`, and she can write
`using MelissasModule` instead of `.using MelissasModule`.

## Register a package

In order for her friends to be able to get the package, Melissa registers the
package in the _general registry_.
This can be done either via [JuliaHub](https://juliahub.com/ui/Registrator) or by making a pull request on
[GitHub](https://github.com/JuliaRegistries/General/pulls) which can also be automated by the [Julia Registrator](https://github.com/JuliaRegistries/Registrator.jl).

## Creating a new package

Melissa thinks next time she will start with a package right away.

Browsing the packages she found [PkgTemplates.jl](https://invenia.github.io/PkgTemplates.jl/stable/) and [PkgSkeleton.jl](https://github.com/tpapp/PkgSkeleton.jl)
which makes setting up the typical folder structure very easy.

## Create your own package

Look at the documentation of the package creation helper packages and create
a new package using `generate`.
