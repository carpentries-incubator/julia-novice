## Conditionals

Now that Melissa knows which method to add she thinks about the implementation.

If the index is `1` she wants to set `counterweight` while if the index is `2`
she wants to set `release_angle` and since these are the only two fields she
wants to return an error if anything else comes in.
In Julia the keywords to specify conditions are `if`, `elseif` and `else`,
closed with an `end`.
Thus she writes

~~~
function Base.setindex!(trebuchet::Trebuchet, v, i::Int)
    if i === 1
        trebuchet.counterweight = v
    elseif i === 2
        trebuchet.release_angle = v
    else
        error("Trebuchet only accepts indices 1 and 2, yours is $i")
    end
end
~~~

### Interfaces

`setindex!` is actually one function of a widespread _interface_ in the Julia
language: `AbstractArray`s.
An interface is a collection of methods that are all implemented by a certain
type.
For example, the [Julia manual][manual] lists all methods that a subtype of
`AbstractArray` need to implement to adhere to the `AbstractArray` interface:

- `size(A)` returns a tuple containing the dimensions of `A`
- `getindex(A, i::Int)` returns the value associated with index `i`
- `setindex!(A, v, i::Int)` writes a new value `v` at the index `i`

If Melissa implements this interface for the `Trebuchet` type, it will work
with every function in `Base` that accepts an `AbstractArray`.

She also needs to make `Trebuchet` a proper subtype of `AbstractArray` as she
tried in [the types episode]({{ site.baseurl }}{%link _episodes/03-types.md
%}).
Therefore she _restarts her REPL_ and redefines `Trebuchet` and `Environment`,
as well as the slurp-and-splat `shoot_distance` function:

~~~
import Trebuchet as Trebuchets

mutable struct Trebuchet <: AbstractVector{Float64}
  counterweight::Float64
  release_angle::Float64
end

struct Environment
    wind::Float64
    target_distance::Float64
end

function shoot_distance(args...)
    Trebuchets.shoot(args...)[2]
end
~~~
{: .language-julia}

Then she goes about implementing the `AbstractArray` interface.

With the new `Trebuchet` defined with a complete `AbstractArray` interface,
Melissa tries again to modify a counterweight by index:

~~~
trebuchet = Trebuchet(500, 0.25pi)
~~~
{: .language-julia}
~~~
2-element Trebuchet:
 500.0
   0.7853981633974483
~~~
{: .output}
~~~
trebuchet[1] = 2

2-element Trebuchet:
   2.0
   0.7853981633974483
~~~
{: .output}

## Loops

Now Melissa knows how to shoot the virtual trebuchet and get the distance of
the projectile, but in order to aim she needs to take a lot of trial shots in a
row.
She wants her trebuchet to only shoot a hundred meters.

She could execute the function several times on the REPL with different
parameters, but that gets tiresome quickly.
A better way to do this is to use loops.

But first Melissa needs a way to improve her parameters.

> ## Digression: Gradients
>
> The `shoot_distance` function takes three input parameters and returns one
> value (the distance).
> Whenever we change one of the input parameters, we will get a different
> distance.
>
> The [_gradient_][grad] of a function gives the direction in which the return
> value will change when each input value changes.
>
> Since the `shoot_distance` function has three input parameters, the gradient

> one direction for each input parameter.
>
> Thanks to [automatic differentiation][autodiff] and the Julia package

{: .callout}

Melissa uses the `gradient` function of `ForwardDiff.jl` to get the direction
in which she needs to change the parameters to make the largest difference.

<!-- TODO: can we get promotion to Trebuchet here? so we can write
julia> grad = gradient(x -> (shoot_distance(x, environment) - environment.target_distance), imprecise_trebuchet)
-->

~~~
using ForwardDiff: gradient

imprecise_trebuchet = Trebuchet(500.0, 0.25pi);
environment = Environment(5.0, 100.0);

grad = gradient(x -> (shoot_distance([environment.wind, x[2], x[1]])
                      - environment.target_distance),
                imprecise_trebuchet)

2-element Vector{Float64}:

Melissa now changes her arguments a little bit in the direction of the gradient
and checks the new distance.

<!-- TODO: can we get promotion to Trebuchet here? -->

~~~
julia> better_trebuchet = imprecise_trebuchet - 0.05 * grad;

julia> shoot_distance([5, better_trebuchet[2], better_trebuchet[1]])

Great! That didn't shoot past the target, but instead it landed a bit too short.

### For loops

Now that Melissa knows it is going in the right direction she wants to automate
the additional iterations.
She writes a new function `aim`, that performs the application of the gradient
`N` times.

~~~
function aim(trebuchet, environment; N = 10, η = 0.05)
           better_trebuchet = copy(trebuchet)
           for _ in 1:N
               grad = gradient(x -> (shoot_distance([environment.wind, x[2], x[1]]) 
                                     - environment.target_distance),
                               better_trebuchet)
               better_trebuchet -= η * grad
               # short form of `better_trebuchet = better_trebuchet - η * grad`
           end
           return Trebuchet(better_trebuchet[1], better_trebuchet[2])
       end

better_trebuchet  = aim(imprecise_trebuchet, environment);

shoot_distance(environment.wind, better_trebuchet[2], better_trebuchet[1])

### While loops

Melissa finds the output of the above `aim` function too unpredictable to be
useful.
That's why she decides to change it a bit.
This time she uses a `while`-loop to run the iterations until she is
sufficiently near her target.

(_Hint:_ __ε__ is `\epsilon`<kbd>tab</kbd>, and __η__ is `\eta`<kbd>tab</kbd>.)

~~~
function aim(trebuchet::Trebuchet, environment::Environment; ε = 0.1, η = 0.05)
    better_trebuchet = copy(trebuchet)
    hit = x -> (shoot_distance([environment.wind, x[2], x[1]])
                - environment.target_distance)
            while abs(hit(better_trebuchet)) > ε
                grad = gradient(hit, better_trebuchet)
                better_trebuchet -= η * grad
            end
            return Trebuchet(better_trebuchet[1], better_trebuchet[2])
        end

better_trebuchet = aim(imprecise_trebuchet, environment);

shoot_distance(better_trebuchet, environment)
~~~
{: .language-julia}
~~~
100.0975848073789
~~~
{: .output}

That is more what she had in mind. Your trebuchet may be tuned differently,
but it should hit just as close as hers.
