Melissa and her schoolmates built a trebuchet in their physics club.
In their first tests they experienced that aiming it is not that easy and intuitive,
so they are planning to write a program that automatically aims their trebuchet given the distance of the target
and the velocity of the wind.

As for the programming language, they chose Julia since it has state-of-the-art packages for this task
and they also read it composes very well.
Unfortunately nobody knows this language already, so they have to learn it from scratch.

<h3> Prerequisites </h3>

You need to understand the concepts of files and directories as well as arrays and indices.

It is beneficial to have some programming experience in another language.

This lesson requires Julia 1.6 or greater
