## Congratulations! You have taken your first steps in the Julia language

Learning any new programming language can be intimidating, and the learning process is never over. However, finishing this workshop is worth celebrating! To review, you have learned:

- How to write and run Julia code
- How to install packages from Julia's repository
- How important Types are in Julia and how to handle them
- How to write if statements, for loops, and functions
- How to organize code into modules and make sure that code is robust to tests

We hope this is just the beginning of your journey in Julia. Below, we detail some ways you can stay connected with the Julia community, connect with other Julia-users in your field, and find resources for writing your own Julia code.

## The Julia Community

As you learn Julia, we encourage you to connect with other users, share questions, and stay involved. Here are a few places you can participate:

- [The JuliaLang Discourse forum](https://discourse.julialang.org/) is a great place to ask Julia-specific questions, read about new Julia packages, and stay up-to-date on community events

- [The Julia Slack](https://julialang.org/slack/) is very active, and people will often respond to questions within minutes
- Likewise you can connect via the [Julia Zulip](https://julialang.zulipchat.com) or [discord](https://discord.com/invite/C5h9D4j).
- It is a good idea to look out for channels called \#helpdesk or similar.

- [The official Julia Documentation](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/) is a more comprehensive overview of programming in Julia, and a good next step to continue learning

- [JuliaCon](https://juliacon.org/2023/) is an annual in-person conference of Julia users, but talks are also streamed online

You can also get Julia help on Stack Overflow, as with other coding languages.

## Domain-specific Julia Organizations

Julia users have also created domain-specific organizations, to better develop packages for specific fields. These can be a great place to go to learn more about the specific Julia packages available for your work. As just a sample:

- [JuliaActuary](https://juliaactuary.org/) for actuarial science
- [JuliaAstro](http://juliaastro.org/dev/index.html) for astronomy
- [EcoJulia](https://ecojulia.org/) for ecological research
- [JuliaRobotics](https://juliarobotics.org/) for robotics control
- [BioJulia](https://biojulia.dev/) for biological and genetic research
- [JuliaGeo](https://juliageo.org/) for geospatial data
- [MLJ](https://juliapackages.com/p/mlj) for machine learning

And many more that you can explore [here!](https://julialang.org/community/organizations/)
