Melissa and her schoolmates built a trebuchet in their physics-club.
In their first tests they experienced that aiming it is not that easy and intuitive, so they are planning to write a program that automatically aims their trebuchet given the distance of the target and the velocity of the wind.
As programming language they chose julia since it has state-of-the-art packages for this tasks and they also read it composes very well.

Unfortunately nobody knows this language already, so they have to learn it from scratch.
