![Trebuchet][trebuchet]{: height="400px"}

Melissa and her schoolmates built a trebuchet in their physics club.
In their first tests they experienced that aiming it is not that easy and
intuitive, so they are planning to write a program that automatically aims
their trebuchet given the distance of the target and the velocity of the wind.

As for the programming language, they chose Julia since it has state-of-the-art
packages for this task and they also read it composes very well.
Unfortunately nobody knows this language already, so they have to learn it from
scratch.
