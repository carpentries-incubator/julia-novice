title: Instructor Notes
---

This course is intended to be taught in conjunction with the shell-novice and git-novice lesson.
The intended time span is not more than 8 hours including breaks.

I recommend starting the lesson using the shell and the julia REPL and then switch to using VSCode/VSCodium latest when writing functions.
